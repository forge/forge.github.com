h1. Forge Update issue


p. We have recently discovered an issue with the *forge update* command that allows people to update to non-final and unstable versions.

This is fixed in 1.2.3.Final, so we kindly ask you to avoid using "forge update" on previous versions since it will prompt you
to update to Forge 2.0.0.Alpha versions (More info about this version soon).

For the meantime, just unzip the desired distribution version until 1.2.3.Final is released (April 15th,2013)

More details in <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/FORGE-849">https://issues.jboss.org/browse/FORGE-849</a>

Thanks for your attention

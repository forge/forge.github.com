h1. Debugging Forge

h2. Forge logfiles

As of CR1 (and SNAPSHOTS since Beta5,) Forge produces a debug logfile located at:

bc(command). $HOME/.forge/runtime.log

h2. Enable debug mode

Start Forge by using the following parameter:

bc(command). forge --debug

If you don't want to use the --debug parameter, you need to set the following FORGE_OPTS (JVM arguments) in your console before starting Forge (this does not work when running Forge in the IDE - it must be run from the command line).

For Unix:

bc(command). export FORGE_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000"

p. For Windows (note no quotes):

bc(command). set FORGE_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000

p. Then run Forge. If you've done this step correctly, Java should state that it is waiting for the debugger to attach on port 8000.

h2. Connect the debugger

If you are using Eclipse, in addition to having the "Forge sources":http://github.com/forge/core imported as projects in your workspace, you will need to create a new project (for this example, call it 'maven-debug'), then right-click on that project, and click "Debug as -> Remote Java Application"

Make sure the remote debugger port is set to 8000 (or the port you've selected,) much like "debugging Maven":http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Dealing+with+Eclipse-based+IDE.

h2. Attach the sources

If Eclipse complains that it cannot find the source attachment for a breakpoint, make sure to add all related Forge projects as source attachments to your new 'maven-debug' project by clicking the "Attach Sources" button.

h1. Improve our documentation

We need your help! Good documentation is one of the most important things for a great Forge experience. It's really easy to help, so if you feel we are missing something in the docs, please add it. Be sure to follow the "contribution guide":http://forge.jboss.org/docs/get_involved/contribute.html when contributing documentation.

The documentation is written in Textile, which is a lightweight markup language. 

h3. Follow these steps to conribute documentation:

# Clone "forge.github.com":http://github.com/forge/forge.github.com on GitHub.
# Add a new .textile file in one of the sub directories of the docs directory. 
# Push the empty Textile file to your GitHub repository.
# Use the GitHub Textile editor to write your docs and preview changes. Of course you can use your own editor if you prefer so.

The "Textile Wikipedia page":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) gives a good introduction about the markup language.

h3. Some technical details

The Forge website is built using Awestruct, and "the sources":http://github.com/forge/forge.github.com are on "github.com":http://github.com/forge/forge.github.com. However you don't have to install anything to contribute documentation! If you are interested in Awestruct anyway, you'll find a guide on the github page about how to setup and use Awestruct.

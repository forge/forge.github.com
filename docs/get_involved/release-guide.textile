h1. Release Guide

h2. Updating Plugin Tags

If you are a Plugin author who wishes to ensure compatibility with the latest Forge release versions - ensure that you update your Plugin to use the corresponding "Forge API version":https://github.com/forge/core/tags. You should also create a git branch in your Plugin repository - the name of this branch should be *exactly the same* as the Forge API version you wish to support.

div(alert alert-info). We recommend using branches instead of tags, because branches allow  bug-fixes; whereas, tags are fixed, and require more work to re-tag a new version with appropriate enhancements of bug-fixes.

h2. Uploading Release Documentation

You must have access to project documentation servers in order to upload project documentation:

bc(command). cd core/git checkout {TAG}
mvn clean javadoc:aggregate -Pjavadoc
rsync -rv --protocol=28Â  target/javadoc/ forge@filemgmt.jboss.org:/docs_htdocs/forge/javadoc/
